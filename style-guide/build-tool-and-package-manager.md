# Build Tool and Package Manager

### **3.1 Webpack x Vite**

Our project leverages both Webpack and Vite to maximize efficiency and performance across different stages of development:

* **Webpack** is used for production builds, ensuring robust optimizations and compatibility with industry-standard deployment requirements.
* **Vite** is utilized for development and testing, offering a faster and more modern developer experience with its lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR).

By combining these tools, we can build efficiently in production while enjoying a fast and enjoyable development experience.
