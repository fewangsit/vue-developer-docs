# Prerequisites

Take a quick look at the [Broken link](/broken/pages/jlnBhjqpC8yhvqNmRW82 "mention")  (hereon referred to as the Coding Style Guide), sections 1 and 2. It introduces the architecture we use.

Here are the programs and package that you should install:

*   [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

    Other IDEs are not recommended because you need to use certain VS Code extensions (linters and formatters) mentioned in the Coding Style Guide.
* [**PNPM**](https://pnpm.io/installation)
*   [**Figma Desktop App**](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

    You can alternatively use the [**Figma web app**](https://www.figma.com/) to access Figma in your browser.

#### **Installing Extensions** <a href="#id-2-installing-extensions" id="id-2-installing-extensions"></a>

At the Style Guide, jump to section [vs-code.md](../style-guide/vs-code.md "mention") and install the necessary VS Code extensions. You can also install the optional extensions, but you can do so later.
