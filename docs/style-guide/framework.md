# Framework

### 1. Vue.JS and TypeScript

Our company uses Vue.JS, especially Vue 3 with Composition API as the main framework and TypeScript as the backbone language. TypeScript is used for better code maintainability and readability.

***

### 2. Architecture

We implement a microservices architecture, utilizing [microtsm](https://github.com/microtsm) to set up our microservices system, making our applications more organized and scalable.

***

### 3. UI Framework Components and Styles

To accelerate development and ensure design consistency across our applications, we utilize our proprietary component Design System called [WangsVue](https://github.com/fewangsit/wangsvue).

***

### 4. Axios

To simplify the connection between our app and API services, we leverage the Axios library. Axios provides a convenient and efficient method for handling HTTP requests, streamlining communication within our applications with our backend services.
