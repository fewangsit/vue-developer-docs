# Framework

### 2.1 Vue.JS and TypeScript

Our company uses Vue.JS, especially Vue 3 with Composition API as the main framework and TypeScript as the backbone language. TypeScript is used for better code maintainability and readability.

### 2.2 Architecture

We implement a microservices architecture, utilizing [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) to set up our microservices system, making our applications more organized and scalable.

***

### 2.3 UI Framework Components and Styles

To speed up production, we use [PrimeVue](https://v3.primevue.org/) for the UI Framework Components with our own custom Tailwind preset.

### 2.3 Axios

To simplify the connection between our app and API services, we leverage the Axios library. Axios provides a convenient and efficient method for handling HTTP requests, streamlining communication within our applications with our backend services.
