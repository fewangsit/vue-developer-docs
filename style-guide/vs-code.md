### **9.2 Useful Shortcuts**

* **Ctrl + Space**: show suggestions for functions, objects, variables, and snippets. This is helpful if you want to quickly import a function from another file or a component from library, among other uses. Type the function or component you want to import, then press Ctrl + Space.
* **Ctrl + Click** (while hovering over a symbol): Go to the definition of the symbol. Symbols are the classes, functions, types, and variable names in your code. For a component, you can also use this to go to the declaration file of the component, which contains what kind of props the component accepts.
* **Ctrl + Shift + P**: run commands. A useful one is 'TypeScript: Restart TS Server' when you have just updated your packages.
* **F2** (while the cursor is on a symbol): Rename symbol. This is useful if you want to, for example, rename an interface across multiple files.
* **Ctrl + D**: selects the next occurrence of the current selection
* **Alt + F3**: selects all occurrences of the current selection
* **Ctrl + P**: navigate through files
* **Ctrl + R**: navigate through projects
