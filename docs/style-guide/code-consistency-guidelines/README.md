These guidelines help maintain consistent, readable code across all projects. Following these standards makes collaboration easier and keeps our codebase maintainable for everyone on the team.

## Overview

This section covers key principles for writing clean, consistent code in our Vue.js + TypeScript projects. It is divided into the following topics:

* [General Principles](general-principles.md) - Naming conventions, imports, and best practices applicable across the codebase.
* [Vue Specific Guidelines](vue-specific-guidelines.md) - Vue.js patterns for templates, script setup, routing, and dependency injection.
* [Configuration & Environment](configuration-environment.md) - Handling environment variables and secure configuration.
